# SharIF Judge

[SharIF Judge](https://github.com/ftisunpar/Sharif-Judge) is a free and open source online judge for C, C++, Java and
Python programming courses. SharIF Judge is a fork of the original [SharIF Judge](https://github.com/mjnaderi/Sharif-Judge) beautifully created by @mjnaderi. This forked version contain many improvements, mostly due to the needs by our faculty at @ftisunpar.

The web interface is written in PHP (CodeIgniter framework) and the main backend is written in BASH.

Python in SharIF Judge is not sandboxed yet. Just a low level of security is provided for python.
If you want to use SharIF Judge for python, USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK or provide sandboxing yourself.

## Requirements

For running SharIF Judge, a Linux server with following requirements is needed:

  * Webserver running PHP version 5.3 or later with `mysqli` extension
  * PHP CLI (PHP command line interface, i.e. `php` shell command)
  * MySql or PostgreSql database
  * PHP must have permission to run shell commands using [`shell_exec()`](http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.shell-exec.php) php function (specially `shell_exec("php");`)
  * Tools for compiling and running submitted codes (`gcc`, `g++`, `javac`, `java`, `python2` and `python3` commands)
  * It is better to have `perl` installed for more precise time and memory limit and imposing size limit on output of submitted code.

## Installation

  1. Download the latest release from [download page](https://github.com/ftisunpar/Sharif-Judge/releases) and unpack downloaded file in your public html directory.
  2. **[Optional]** Move folders `system` and `application` somewhere outside your public directory. Then save their full path in `index.php` file (`$system_path` and `$application_folder` variables).
  3. Create a MySql or PostgreSql database for SharIF Judge. Do not install any database connection package for C/C++, Java or Python.
  4. Set database connection settings in `application/config/database.php`.
  5. Make `application/cache/Twig` writable by php.
  6. Open the main page of SharIF Judge in a web browser and follow the installation process.
  7. Log in with your admin account.
  8. **[IMPORTANT]** Move folders `tester` and `assignments` somewhere outside your public directory. Then save their full path in `Settings` page. **These two folders must be writable by PHP.** Submitted files will be stored in `assignments` folder. So it should be somewhere not publicly accessible.
  9. **[IMPORTANT]** [Secure SharIF Judge](https://github.com/ftisunpar/Sharif-Judge/blob/docs/v1.4/security.md)

## After Installation

  * Read the [documentation](https://github.com/ftisunpar/Sharif-Judge/tree/docs)

## Running The Testing

  
  1. Clone the project first `git clone https://github.com/ferdianexe/Sharif-Judge.git`
  2. If you dont have MySQL install it first.
  3. Create new database in MySQL.
  **[IMPORTANT]** For testing you need to run the test in new database, otherwise **ALL** data will be lost.
  4. Run ```composer install```, install composer to your system if it the system doesn't already have composer.
  5. Make sure the files `application/config/database.php` and `application/config/secrets.php` exist in the config folder. If it doesn't exist, make a copy of `application/config/database.example.php` or `application/config/secrets.example.php` and rename it.
  6. Set new database connection settings in `application/config/database.php`.
  7. Make `application/cache/Twig` writable by php.
  8. Create a folder in root directory for example `reports-dev` it will be the place where the Test Reports and Code Coverage will be rendered  
  9. Create a new folder in directory `restricted/`. give the folder name `assignments`
  10. Run the migrations first in terminal `php index.php tests/Migrations`
  **[IMPORTANT]** You dont need to to this again if there is database that used to do the testing
  11. in `controllers/test/RunTest.php`. check this line of code 
  ```$writer->process($this->coverage, '`reports-dev`/code-coverage');```
  and
  ```file_put_contents('`reports-dev`/test_report.html', $this->unit->report());```
  change ONLY the `reports-dev` to the folder that you made in the step 8.
  12. If you want to render the code coverage result, set `const ENABLE_COVERAGE` value in `controllers/test/RunTest.php` to `TRUE `
  **[IMPORTANT]** xdebug needed.
  13. To run the test in terminal, run the command ```php index.php tests/RunTest```.
  The test result will be printed in the terminal.
